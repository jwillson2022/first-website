          <p>This is a drawing I did in 4 diffent colours, I split the page in to four sections and drawing a basic
            outline in pencil first. Then inked in each section blending alittle of the neighbouring in to each section.

          <h3>Digital Drawing</h3>
          <p>This a Digital drawing I did on my tablet, on an app called Ibis paint. The process of digital drawing is
            not the same as drawing with a pen. It is easier to colour and edit than a hand draw image, which has to be
            scanned and traced. I hope one day to be able to get an ipad and pen which is top end tech. </p>
